Project 6: mush

    This assignment is to make a simple shell. We must implement:
    - Interactive batch processing 
        -> if no arguments, take cmds from stdin until ^D or exit
        -> if args read commands from argv
    - Support for redirection
        -> <, >, and | to feed output of one command to input of another
    - Built-in cd command
        -> ***CD CANNOT BE RUN AS A CHILD PROCESS
    - Support for SIGINT
        -> When ^C is typed, shell doesn't die but terminate any running
            children and reset itself.

    mush looks and acts like a simple shell. It does not support tab
    auto-complete or an up-arrow for history (yet). And it definitely
    does not support bash-like shell scripting. Stick to GNU commands
    and it works great and is pretty fun, until you want to auto-complete
    or get your history. 
    The SIGINT doesn't work perfectly, that could use some work.

Special Instructions: No special instructions. Usage is as follows
 	./mush to start the shell. Supports SIGINT, file redirection,
	and pipes. To run in script mode: ./mush <filename>.
